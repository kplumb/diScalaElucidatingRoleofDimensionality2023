The sustained interest in investigating magnetism in the two-dimensional (2D) limit of insulating antiferromagnets has been driven by the possibilities of discovering, or engineering, novel magnetic phases through layer stacking. However, due to the difficulty of directly measuring magnetic interactions in 2D antiferromagnets, it is not yet understood how \emph{intra}layer magnetic interactions in \emph{insulating}, strongly correlated, materials can be modified through layer proximity. Herein, we explore the impact of reduced dimensionality in the model van der Waals antiferromagnet \NPS{} by measuring electronic excitations in exfoliated samples using Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS). The resulting spectra shows systematic broadening of \NiS{} multiplet excitations with decreasing layer count from bulk down to three atomic layers (3L). We show that these trends originate from a decrease in transition metal-ligand and ligand-ligand hopping integrals, and by charge-transfer energy evolving from $\Delta$ = 0.83 eV in the bulk to 0.37 eV in 3L \NPS{}. Relevant intralayer magnetic exchange integrals computed from the electronic parameters exhibit a decrease in the average interaction strength with thickness. This study underscores the influence of \emph{inter}layer electronic interactions on \emph{intra}layer ones in insulating magnets, indicating that magnetic Hamiltonians in few-layer insulating magnets can greatly deviate from their bulk counterparts.
